            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Crop production is vital for food security, farmer income, and rural livelihoods. However, farmers face significant challenges such as unpredictable weather, soil degradation, pest infestations, and water scarcity, all of which can impact crop productivity. Current tools often provide fragmented or outdated information, lacking the comprehensive guidance necessary for effective decision-making.

Our goal is to provide accurate, timely, and actionable crop recommendations, empowering farmers to optimize yields and contribute to enhanced food security and economic resilience in South Africa.
